## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`BasicJavaProblems/`** → Beginner-friendly Java programs (Fibonacci, Palindrome, Prime numbers, etc.)

  * Each subfolder has its own `README.md` for explanations.
* More categories (e.g., **Intermediate**, **Advanced**, **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**) will be added in the future.
